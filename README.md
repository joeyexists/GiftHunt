# Gift Hunt

Gift Hunt is a Neon White mod that lets you hide gifts in levels and challenge your friends to find them, or search for gifts hidden by others!

## Hiding gifts
- Press the hide gift hotkey (default: Right Shift) to hide a gift at your current location. You can change the keybind via Melon Preferences.
- A gift seed will be generated based on your player's position and automatically copied to your clipboard.
    - You can also find the seed in the MelonLoader console or in 
      `Neon White\MelonLoader\Latest.log`

## Finding gifts
- To load a gift, either copy a gift seed and press the load gift hotkey (default: `\`), or paste the gift seed directly into the "Gift Seed" field within the mod preferences.
- The mod will automatically load the correct level with the gift in place.

### Additional Notes
- Collecting gifts will increment your gift counter, but that shouldn't affect anything.
- This mod has not been tested with unfinished playthroughs.

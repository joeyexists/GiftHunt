# GiftHunt

A scuffed interpretation of Luigi's Balloon World in Neon White.

### Hiding Gifts

* Press the hide gift hotkey (default: `Right Shift`) to hide a gift where you're standing. A seed will be copied to your clipboard, which includes the level, position, and your dev time.

> The seed will also appear in the MelonLoader console, or you can find it in `Neon White\MelonLoader\Latest.log`

### Finding Gifts

* To load a gift, copy a gift seed and press the load gift hotkey (default: `\`) or paste it into the gift seed field within melon preferences. The mod will automatically load the level and the gift.

### Other Features

* **Dev Times** - Every gift seed records your hide time, and other players can see it after beating it.
* **Custom Keybinds** - All keybinds can be changed in melon preferences.
* **PB Tracking** - Your PB is tracked while a gift seed is loaded, with green numbers included!
* **Does not affect your gift count** - Collecting GiftHunt gifts wont increment your gift count, so you don't have to worry about getting stuck in an endless loop giving hundreds of gifts 🔥
